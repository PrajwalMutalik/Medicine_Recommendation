# Medicine Predictor 
# Overview
 <a href = "https://medicine-advisor.onrender.com/" >
This project is a Disease Prediction and Treatment Recommendation System that leverages machine learning techniques to predict the type of disease based on user-inputted symptoms. Additionally, it provides a list of treatments, recommended ingredients, and dietary suggestions to help manage or cure the predicted condition.

The project has two main components:

Backend (Machine Learning): Implemented in Python for disease prediction.

Frontend: Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for an intuitive and user-friendly interface.

# Features

Symptom-based Disease Prediction: Users can input their symptoms, and the system predicts the most probable disease.

Treatment Suggestions: Displays potential treatments for the predicted disease.

Dietary Recommendations: Suggests ingredients and foods that may help alleviate symptoms or improve recovery.

Interactive Interface: A clean and simple web interface for user interactions.

# Technologies Used

Backend (Machine Learning):

Programming Language: Python

# Libraries:

Pandas: For data preprocessing and handling.

NumPy: For numerical computations.

Scikit-learn: For implementing and training the machine learning model.

Flask: To serve the model as a REST API.

# Frontend:

Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
